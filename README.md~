Django-driven web client for searching Marvel and DC characters

To run the client,
    ~/cs122project/ui$python3 manage.py runserver
and navigate to 127.0.0.1:8000.

Select the universe to search. Selecting "Search by Attribute" and hitting
Submit allows for the selection of other search options.

The graph option displays the hero network, graphing the connections between
the hero name given and all characters that appear alongside that hero.
Setting the Max no. of Edges produces a second graph limiting the connected
characters to the x number of characters with the most co-appearances. Be
aware that characters with large numbers of connections may take up to 30
seconds to produce.

The Aggregation folder contains the produced code in more organized chunks to facilitate grading. Note that running programs in the Aggregation/used folder, while the same files as in the /ui/ folder, will not run because they rely on code in the other folders.
